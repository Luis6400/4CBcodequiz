# 4CBcodequiz

## Description

This Project is a coding quiz on matters we have learned in my coding boot camp. The game keeps track of score, saves score with a name into localstorage and presents a ranked list of scores in a highscores page. My favorite feature of the game is that you can enter and exit the highscores page mid-game and come back to the game where you left off. The timer also stops when checking highscores with a pause function.
